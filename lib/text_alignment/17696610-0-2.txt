Mouse Pachytene Checkpoint 2(Trip13)Is Required for Completing Meiotic
Recombination but Not Synapsis
In mammalian meiosis, homologous chromosome synapsis is coupled with
recombination. As in most eukaryotes, mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints
that monitor the fidelity of these processes. We report that the mouse
ortholog of pachytene checkpoint 2, an essential component
of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis
elegans, is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes.
TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of
oocytes around birth. The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully,
yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates, including RAD51,
BLM, and RPA. These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1
and MLH3, and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused
progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes. Double mutant analysis
demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis genes Spo11, Mei1, Rec8,
and Dmc1 are all epistatic to Trip13, suggesting that TRIP13 does not have
meiotic checkpoint function in mice. Our data indicate that TRIP13 is
required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination
