{"text": "Loss of function mutations in the rice homeobox gene OsH15 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants . The rice homeobox gene OsH15 oryza sativa homeobox is a member of the knotted1 type homeobox gene family . We report here on the identification and characterization of a loss of function mutation in OsH15 from a library of OsretrotranspON tagged lines of rice . Based on the phenotype and map position we have identified three independent deletion alleles of the locus among conventional morphological mutants . All of these recessive mutations which are considered to be null alleles exhibit defects in internode elongation . Introduction of a 14 kbp genomic dna fragment that includes all exons introns and 5 and 3 flanking sequences of OsH15 complemented the defects in internode elongation confirming that they were caused by the loss of function of OsH15 . Internodes of the mutants had abnormal shaped epidermal and hypodermal cells and showed an unusual arrangement of small vascular bundles . These mutations demonstrate a role for OsH15 in the development of rice internodes .
