{"text": "We have isolated a cdna RGRC2 encoding glutathione reductase gr from rice oryza sativa l.. . The recombinant RGRC2 protein had enzymatic properties comparable to those of gr from rice embryo . Subcellular fractionation showed that the RGRC2 protein is localized primarily in cytosol . Mrna and protein of RGRC2 were observed mainly in roots and calli but little in leaf tissues . Southern blot analysis showed that the RGRC2 gene exists as a single copy gene . Here we have also isolated a genomic clone completely corresponding to rgrc2 . The RGRC2 gene is split into 16 exons spread about 7.4 kb of chromosomal dna with coding sequence beginning in the 2nd exon and ending in the 16th exon . From the presence of two aba responsive elements in the 5 flanking region of rgrc2 we examined the expression in rice seedlings treated with aba and the aba related environmental stresses chilling drought and salinity . The expression of RGRC2 was strongly induced by all these treatments . We suggest that the expression of the rice OscytOLIC gr gene is regulated via aba mediated signal transduction pathway under environmental stresses . Molecular cloning and expression analysis of rice OsphPHORIBULOKINASE gene that is regulated by environmental stresses .
