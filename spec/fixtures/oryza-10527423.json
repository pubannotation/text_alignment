{"text": "Analysis of proteins expressed in the root TIPS identified several aba induced or repressed proteins including actin depolymerization factor adf late embryo abundant protein lea putative steroid membrane binding protein FERREDOXIN thionine reductase and calcium binding protein . Membrane intrinsic proteins facilitate movement of small molecules often times functioning as water channels . We have identified two genes from rice which encode proteins with characteristic features of plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pip . The two genes were expressed at higher levels in seedlings than in adult plants and expression in the primary root was regulated by light . In internodes of deepwater rice plants which were induced to grow rapidly by submergence transcript levels were slightly induced in the intercalary meristem im and slightly reduced in the elongation zone ez after 18 h . In internodes of ga induced excised stem sections transcript levels transiently declined in the im and ez after 1 h and subsequently recovered to elevated levels after 18 h . Ga also induced OsPIP expression in non growing tissue after 18 h . In the im of submergence induced stem sections transcript levels remained constitutive . In fact treatment of excised stem sections with aba or drought stress induced similar changes in OsPIP expression in the growing zone during the first 6 h as ga did . Ga induced growth may however change the water status of cells which in turn results in altered pip abundance .
