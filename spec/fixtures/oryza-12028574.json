{"text": "We show that the fusion protein of el5 with maltose binding protein mbp was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin UBIQUITIN activating enzyme e1 and the UBC45 subfamily of the UBIQUITIN conjugating enzyme e2 . El5 possesses the activity to catalyse the TRANSFER of UBIQUITIN to the mbp moiety and the ring h2 finger motif of el5 is necessary for this activity . Thus we concluded that el5 represents a UBIQUITIN ligase e3 . We also show that two rice e2s OsUBC5A OsUBC5B of the UBC45 subfamily function as e2 which catalyses el5 mediated ubiquitination and OsUBC5B was induced by elicitor as well as el5 .
