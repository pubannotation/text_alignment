{"text": "A natural allele of a transcription factor in rice confers broad spectrum blast resistance . Non race specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability . Through a genome wide association study we report the identification of a natural allele of a c2h2 type transcription factor in rice that confers non race specific resistance to blast . A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10 of rice suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding . This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr D1 gene which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and consequently an inhibition of h2o2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance . Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice .
